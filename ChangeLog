2010.10.20 v0.0.31

* Kill workers if they aren't dead after 30 seconds.
* New option worker_kill_timeout - when master is stopping, time to let workers kill themselves before REALLY killing them (miliseconds). defaults to 30000 (30 seconds).
* Throws Error instances instead of strings when something goes wrong.

2010.10.11 v0.0.30

* Protected worker killing from throwing an exception when the worker is no longer there, in order to not compromise the whole shutdown process.
* Fixed some tests on linux. For some reason, linux has more process affinity and it's harder to make him balance between workers.

2010.10.11 v0.0.29

* fixed connection counting on the workers

2010.10.11 v0.0.28

* fixed a racing condition while shutting down the workers

2010.10.11 v0.0.27

* fixed a possible racing condition for access to master pid file when respawning

2010.10.11 v0.0.26

* Now uses carrier (http://github.com/pgte/carrier) as a way to implement line reading on protocol

2010.10.06 v0.0.25

* Fixed race condition between launching workers and asynchronous binding on master socket
* On sudden master death, somehow the workers should eventually realize that their master has died and kill themselves.
* added fugue.workerPids()
* added options.worker_to_master_ping_interval
* Worker notifies master that he is also listening, so master can more accurately count him in in order to invoke the options.started callback.

2010.10.05 v0.0.22

* Now workers file descriptors (stdin, stdout, stderr) are the same as the master process, so there is no longer the need to pipe them from worker into master.

2010.10.05 v0.0.20

* Fixed some important leaks that were preventing node to end after fugue.stop();
* Added "started" callback to fugue.start();

2010.10.03 v0.0.19

* Reviewed the code that synchronously tries to fetch the file descriptor from the original master into the new respawned master (luismreis)
* improved fugue.stop (pgte)
* added test-fail target to test if tests are failing correctly on spawned test children processes (pgte)
* reviewed teardown of some tests (pgte)

2010.10.01 v0.0.15

* Added tests: zero_workers, one_worker, i_can_reach_many_workers, app_reload (pgte);

* Move verbose test out of log function and into configuration. If there's need to change logging at run time, then this code can be easily moved into a (new) function. (luismreis);

* new fugue.stop() function (pgte);

* options.verbose now defaults to false;
