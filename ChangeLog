2010.10.05 v0.0.20

* Fixed some important leaks that were preventing node to end after fugue.stop();
* Added "started" callback to fugue.start();

2010.10.03 v0.0.19

* Reviewed the code that synchronously tries to fetch the file descriptor from the original master into the new respawned master (luismreis)
* improved fugue.stop (pgte)
* added test-fail target to test if tests are failing correctly on spawned test children processes (pgte)
* reviewed teardown of some tests (pgte)

2010.10.01 v0.0.15

* Added tests: zero_workers, one_worker, i_can_reach_many_workers, app_reload (pgte);

* Move verbose test out of log function and into configuration. If there's need to change logging at run time, then this code can be easily moved into a (new) function. (luismreis);
