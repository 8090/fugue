2010.10.11 v0.0.26

* Now uses carrier (http://github.com/pgte/carrier) as a way to implement line reading on protocol

2010.10.06 v0.0.25

* Fixed race condition between launching workers and asynchronous binding on master socket
* On sudden master death, somehow the workers should eventually realize that their master has died and kill themselves.
* added fugue.workerPids()
* added options.worker_to_master_ping_interval
* Worker notifies master that he is also listening, so master can more accurately count him in in order to invoke the options.started callback.

2010.10.05 v0.0.22

* Now workers file descriptors (stdin, stdout, stderr) are the same as the master process, so there is no longer the need to pipe them from worker into master.

2010.10.05 v0.0.20

* Fixed some important leaks that were preventing node to end after fugue.stop();
* Added "started" callback to fugue.start();

2010.10.03 v0.0.19

* Reviewed the code that synchronously tries to fetch the file descriptor from the original master into the new respawned master (luismreis)
* improved fugue.stop (pgte)
* added test-fail target to test if tests are failing correctly on spawned test children processes (pgte)
* reviewed teardown of some tests (pgte)

2010.10.01 v0.0.15

* Added tests: zero_workers, one_worker, i_can_reach_many_workers, app_reload (pgte);

* Move verbose test out of log function and into configuration. If there's need to change logging at run time, then this code can be easily moved into a (new) function. (luismreis);

* new fugue.stop() function (pgte);

* options.verbose now defaults to false;
